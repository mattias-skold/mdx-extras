# project init setup

- create a pnpm managed workspace for packages that ship mdxeditor plugins
- create one package that ships a source preview plugin for mdxeditor - for now, just create the initial setup, no features
- create a shared tooling package that includes the latest vite, prettier, and eslint configurations and packages.
- the eslint config should be strict and should enable typescript rules
